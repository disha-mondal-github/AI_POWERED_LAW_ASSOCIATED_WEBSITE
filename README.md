## Project Overview

This project, developed by the team "Neural Diffusers" (Amritanshu Lahiri and Disha Mondal), is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist lawyers and legal professionals. It was created for the Generative AI Buildathon by YourStory and 100xEngineers.

### Key Features

#### Case Summarization
Provide users with summarized versions of legal cases, highlighting key points, precedents, and relevant legal principles.

#### Statutory Interpretation
Assist users in interpreting statutes and regulations by analyzing language, context, and relevant case law. The goal of statutory interpretation is to determine the legal meaning of legislation or the meaning that conveys the legislative intention.

#### Legal Database Integration
Integration with legal databases and repositories to access a vast collection of legal documents, enabling the chatbot to provide up-to-date and relevant information.

#### Options
The chatbot provides the following options:

- **Legal Research**: Solve law-related queries.
- **Case-specific Legal Advice**: Provide advice on specific legal cases.
- **Law-related Ethical Dilemmas**: Solve law-related ethical dilemmas.
- **Recent Legal News**: Provide updates on recent legal news.

#### Web Scraping
Unlock the vast expanse of legal knowledge on the web with the AI's web scraping capability. Seamlessly extract relevant data from online sources, including court decisions, legal articles, and statutes, to enrich legal research and analysis.

#### Research Assistance
Based on the information extracted from legal documents, the chatbot will conduct thorough research on case law, precedents, and legal doctrines to provide lawyers with comprehensive insights and recommendations.

#### Strategic Recommendations
The chatbot will generate strategic recommendations for case preparation and litigation based on its analysis of the legal documents and research findings. This could include suggesting potential arguments, identifying strengths and weaknesses in the case, and proposing legal strategies.

## Architecture

1. **Workflow Creation**: The team first created a workflow on Voiceflow to define the chatbot's functionality and interactions.

2. **Training Data**: The chatbot was trained on various legal cases, the Constitution of India, the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, laws and ethics, and other relevant legal documents.

3. **Workflow Design**: The workflow was designed to perform all the stated objectives.

4. **Integration with Voiceglow**: After completing the workflow, its API key was used to connect it with Voiceglow, a platform for designing and deploying conversational AI applications.

5. **Bot Interface Design**: In Voiceglow, the team designed the bot's interface and integrated the generated code with the code of their website.

6. **Deployment**: After integrating the bot with the website, it was ready for deployment.

## Setup

After designing the UI of the website with necessary CSS and JavaScript, the website was made responsive, and the chatbot was integrated to complete the AI-powered Law Associate.

## API Documentation

The API key from Voiceflow was provided in Voiceglow to allow for further stylization of the chatbot's UI.
